This project was created by Emma Keeley, Clarissa Hall and Amy Loddington as part of our 8 week Introduction to Web Development Course run by Code First Girls and sponsored by Slalom.

We used HTML, CSS and Javascript, collaborating using Github as a version control system to build our final product.

The Hero Image gallery was created using pure JavaScript.

One of the key challenges of the project was when we initally merged our code together, and we had styling clashes which meant the design of the page was compromised. To resolve this we had to work through our class names, and make sure their were no clashes.
